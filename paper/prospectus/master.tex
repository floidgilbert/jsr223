\abstract{
The R package \textbf{jsr223} is a high-level integration for the Java platform. It makes Java objects easy to use from within R; it provides a unified interface to integrate R with several programming languages; and it features extensive data exchange between R and Java. This integration leverages the performance benefits and cross-platform capabilities of the Java platform.

\acknowledgments{Thank you, Dr. Dahl, for conceiving the idea to use JSR-223 in R, for providing me with the opportunity to execute the project, and for ample guidance and feedback. Thank you Laura, Kira, and Rulon, for your light. Finally, I will not hesitate to thank God. He is woefully under-cited in academic papers.}
