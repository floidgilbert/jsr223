\chapter{Proposal}

To complete the project requirement for a Masters degree in Statistics from BYU, I propose to do the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Complete and submit the R software packages \textbf{jsr223} and \textbf{jdx} to The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) for distribution. The \textbf{jdx} package is not mentioned in this prospectus, but it will be discussed in the technical sections of the completed paper. The \textbf{jdx} package provides the core data exchange functionality for \textbf{jsr223}. Both \textbf{jsr223} and \textbf{jdx} will include R documentation and a vignette.

\item Complete and submit the associated paper to the \href{http://journal.r-project.org}{R Journal} \\ (\href{http://journal.r-project.org}{http://journal.r-project.org}). The paper will include: i.) an extended software review with other relevant software packages; ii.) a vignette to demonstrate the package's functionality; and iii.) code examples for each of the supported languages.
\end{enumerate}
