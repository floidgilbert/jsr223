\chapter{Proposal}

To complete the project requirement for a Masters degree in Statistics from BYU, I propose to do the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Submit the R software package \textbf{jsr223} to CRAN, The Comprehensive R Archive Network, for distribution. The package includes documentation and a vignette.

\item Submit the associated paper to the \href{http://journal.r-project.org}{R Journal} (http://journal.r-project.org). The completed paper will include an extended software review with other relevant software packages in addition to \textbf{rJava}, and a vignette to demonstrate the package's functionality.
\end{enumerate}
