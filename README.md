# jsr223
A Java Platform Integration for R with Programming Languages Groovy, JavaScript, JRuby (Ruby), Jython (Python), and Kotlin

:warning: **This project is archived.** The release of Java 17 broke core compatibility with this integration. Thank you to all who used and supported jsr223.

The R package **jsr223** is a high-level integration for the Java platform. It makes Java objects easy to use from within R; it provides a unified interface to integrate R with several programming languages; and it features extensive data exchange between R and Java. In all, **jsr223** significantly extends the computing capabilities of the R software environment.

The **jsr223** package is available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=jsr223). A complete [user manual](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/jsr223/vignettes/jsr223.pdf) is included in the vignettes. A [supporting paper](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2018/RJ-2018-066/index.html) has been published in the *R Journal*.

**Note: The JavaScript engine Nashorn is deprecated in Java 11. Do not use Nashorn for future development.**
