# jsr223
A Java Platform Integration for R with Programming Languages Groovy, JavaScript, JRuby (Ruby), Jython (Python), and Kotlin

The **jsr223** package provides a high-level integration for Java that makes Java objects easy to use from within R and simplifies bi-directional data exchange for a wide variety of objects. Furthermore, **jsr223** employs the Java Scripting API (an implementation of JSR-223) to bring five scripting languages to the R software environment: JavaScript, Ruby, Python, Groovy, and Kotlin.
